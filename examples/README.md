# Electron-Tracking examples

Folder to contain Geant4 (or otherwise) examples to test individual features of the code target. 

These examples are ideally 
drawn from Geant4 examples and adapted to the Electron-Tracking purpose. They should come in their own folders with build 
instructions and run separately from the main code.
